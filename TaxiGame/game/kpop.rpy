    hb "Listen, she's my best friend. She's been my best friend since we were kids. But we lost sight of each other after we graduated and recently we met again by coincidence."
    hb "The love of my life is leaving, and I can't let her go. Please, we don't have a moment to lose."
    y "I understand, young man. Don't worry, I'll do my best to get you to the airport on time."

        y "What you're friend?"

        y "That doesn't sound too good."
        hb "And I still don't even know what my mother said, I know she's against us being together, but she won't be able to keep us apart!"
        y "Love is a powerful thing, my friend. I've seen many stories unfold in this taxi. Sometimes, the heart's desire is all that matters."
        y "We're almost at the airport, now go get her!"

        y "I get it man, but you're no good to her dead, we really need to keep to the speed limit and traffic is terrible this time of day."
        hb "You're right, it's not you're fault, I'm sorry. I'm just so worried I'll never see her again. After what my mother did, I don't even know if Joo-yeon will forgive me."

        hb "I Don't really know. All I know is that my mother and her had a talk when suddenly Joo-yeon ran out of there crying."
        hb "I wouldn't even know she's leaving if my mother's assistant hadn't told me about the boarding ticket."
        y "Is there a reason your mother doesn't approve of this girl of yours?"
        hb "Well my mother is very old-fashioned and we don't really come from the same social standing. But that shouldn't matter anymore in this day and age. Can't you go faster?"
        y "I'm going exactly as fast as is reasonable, maybe you should have talked with her before she was heading to an airport."
        hb "I didn't even know, don't make it sound like this is all on me."
